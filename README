Speech Search - a module for XOOPS and ImpressCMS

Overview
========
This module adds a search block which supports entry by the proposed Web Speech API standard for HTML5 to a XOOPS or ImpressCMS site. The block degrades gracefully to a normal search block if the Web Speech API is not supported by the browser. (As of the time of this writing, only Google Chrome version 25 or above supports this API.)

Installation
============
The distribution archive can be expanded directly into the main directory of your XOOPS or ImpressCMS site. Then, install the speechsearch module from the system administration area of your CMS.

Usage
=====
Enable the Speech Search block. To activate speech search, click the microphone icon in the search box. Status and other feedback is presented as a title (tooltip) to the icon.

The user must allow the CMS site access to the microphone for speech input to be accepted. Any recognized speech will be used as a search query, and results will be returned using the normal search result mechanisms.

Presently, user authorization over https is persistent, while it must be repeated on each invocation over http. This is part of Google's specification and implementation, not the Speech Search module.

Notes
=====
The javascript access to the Web Speech API was largely based on the demo code available here:

This module has been tested in ImpressCMS versions 1.2.7 and 1.3.4, and in Xoops version 2.5.5.
